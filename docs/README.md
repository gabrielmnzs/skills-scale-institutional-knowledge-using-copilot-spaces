# OctoAcme Project Management — Overview

OctoAcme runs projects using a lightweight, stage-gated lifecycle that moves from Initiation to Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each stage has clear artifacts to keep work aligned and visible: a Project One-pager (problem, goal, success metrics), a roadmap/release plan, sprint/iteration backlogs, acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, and a risk register. Initiation validates the business case and stakeholder alignment, planning breaks approved initiatives into prioritized, estimated backlog items and a release/milestone map, execution uses short iterations and pull request-driven delivery, and release and deployment follow a rollback-ready checklist; retrospectives capture learnings and track improvement actions.

Day-to-day workflows emphasize small, reviewable work and visible boards. Teams use a project board with columns such as Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done. Pull requests should be small, include issue links and acceptance criteria, and be gated by CI (tests, linting, and security scans) and required approvals before merge. Team rhythm includes short daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs to surface risks and show progress, regular demos at the end of sprints or milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates for broader visibility.

Roles and communication are clearly defined and practiced: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Product Managers own vision, prioritization, and success metrics; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria; and stakeholders provide direction and approvals. Communication cadence includes weekly PM⇄PdM alignment, twice-weekly or daily delivery standups, and an escalation path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) for business-impacting issues. Risk management lives in a simple Risk Register with owners, impacts, mitigations, and a regular review cadence.

Quality assurance and continuous improvement are built into the pipeline. Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests (plus security scans) run in CI and gate merges; manual QA and smoke tests are required before releases, which include rollback and incident playbooks. Retrospectives are timeboxed and focused on a small set of actionable improvements that are tracked into the backlog with owners and due dates, and their impact is reviewed in weekly PM syncs to close the continuous improvement loop.
