# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

## Role-Based Communication Responsibilities
Clarify who is responsible for key communications:
- **Project Manager**: Weekly status updates, stakeholder briefings, escalation coordination
- **Product Manager**: Roadmap updates, feature announcements, customer-facing communications
- **Scrum Master**: Team ceremony facilitation, impediment escalation
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation updates, release notes, onboarding materials
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment announcements, incident notifications
- **QA Lead**: Quality gate status, test coverage reports
